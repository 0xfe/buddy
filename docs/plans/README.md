# Plans Directory

- `docs/plans/` is for active/in-progress planning documents.
- `docs/plans/completed/` stores completed, superseded, and historical plan artifacts.
- When a plan is finished or no longer relevant, move it into `completed/` instead of deleting it.

Current state:
- no active plan files at this level.
- all historical plans are archived in `docs/plans/completed/`.
